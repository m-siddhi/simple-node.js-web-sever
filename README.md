I created a simple Node.js web server using the http module. 
It listens on port 3000 and serves three HTML pages: /home, /about, /contact. 
Invalid routes show a custom 404 page. 
All code is written manually without AI assistance. 
Screenshots and logs show the server running and handling routes correctly.
